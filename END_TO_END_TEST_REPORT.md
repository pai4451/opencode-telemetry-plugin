# End-to-End Correlation Test Report

**Test Date:** 2026-01-23
**Test Type:** Manual end-to-end validation with clean data
**Result:** ✅ **100% SUCCESS** - System is production-ready

---

## Test Scenario

### Setup
1. Cleared all previous data:
   - metrics.jsonl
   - traces.jsonl
   - Plugin log
   - MongoDB collections

2. Generated fresh data using OpenCode:
   - Edited merge_sort.cpp
   - Accepted some suggestions (manual "once")
   - Rejected some suggestions
   - Switched to "always accept" (auto-approve)
   - Final result: 11 edit operations

### User Actions Captured
```
Session: ses_415e0d216ffeOTZvRHZYF85ZQh
User: <username>
Prompt: "Please edit merge_sort.cpp to change all chinese comments to english"

Actions:
- 6 manual accepts (clicked "Accept")
- 1 manual "always" (clicked "Always")
- 2 auto-approves (no dialog)
- 2 rejects (clicked "Reject")
Total: 11 edit operations
```

---

## Verification Results

### ✅ 1. Data Consistency

| Source | Edit Operations | Match Rate |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| **Plugin Log** | 11 call_ids | Baseline |
| **Metrics File** | 11 call_ids | 100% ✓ |
| **Traces File** | 17 call_ids (11 edits + 6 other tools) | 100% ✓ |
| **Overlap** | 11 call_ids in BOTH | 100% ✓ |

**Call IDs Found:**
```
✓ toolu_0133cCkv4g51xLJme9yVnxsf
✓ toolu_015LFcPkWYkjjgW47XRuLF3u
✓ toolu_01Csm9xd1aqhU1FCxotaXtbb
✓ toolu_01HteZTXi3kBZeGUpiSuGq1L
✓ toolu_01MCHpXJbc3VhbJcX4gBb2A1
✓ toolu_01MvUDsxByk7e17iboFbLZbC
✓ toolu_01R5HESnKZ9N5yEM8ZyK1eRK
✓ toolu_01RYycu3RqZtoRVWZDMmiJEg
✓ toolu_01T43SxXKEBYH4bJskuhdcEN
✓ toolu_01XQD6aPFZm9yrciuAjCQ31b
✓ toolu_01XQGpZg8X6QM49UoZ1HxNhV
```

### ✅ 2. Session Context Injection

**Expected from Plugin Log:**
```
Session ID: ses_415e0d216ffeOTZvRHZYF85ZQh
Log message: "Injected session context into span: sessionID=ses_415e0d216ffeOTZvRHZYF85ZQh"
```

**Found in Traces:**
```
✓ session.id: ses_415e0d216ffeOTZvRHZYF85ZQh
✓ user: <username>
✓ file.path: /home/<username>/opencode-telemetry-plugin/merge_sort.cpp
✓ language: cpp
```

**Result:** Session context injection working perfectly! ✅

### ✅ 3. MongoDB Collections

**Insertion Results:**
```
✓ Prompt collection: 17 records inserted
✓ Metrics collection: 11 records inserted
✓ Database: opencode_telemetry
✓ Both collections have call_id field
```

### ✅ 4. Correlation Queries

**Test Query: Find accepted edits with their prompts**
```javascript
db.metrics.aggregate([
  { $match: { accept: true } },
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: 'prompt',
      localField: 'call_id',
      foreignField: 'call_id',
      as: 'prompt_data'
    }
  }
])
```

**Result:** ✅ Found 9 correlated records (9 accepted edits out of 11 total)

**Sample Correlated Data:**
```json
{
  "accept": true,
  "ai_loc": 4,
  "filepath": "/home/<username>/opencode-telemetry-plugin/merge_sort.cpp",
  "user": "<username>",
  "call_id": "toolu_01HteZTXi3kBZeGUpiSuGq1L",
  "user_prompt": "Please edit merge_sort.cpp to change all chinese comments to english",
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
  "total_tokens": 925,
  "tool_name": "edit"
}
```

## Analysis Results

### User Behavior Patterns

#### Acceptance Analysis
```
Total Edits: 11
├─ Accepted: 9 (81.8%)
│  ├─ Manual "once": 6 edits (67%)
│  ├─ Manual "always": 1 edit (11%)
│  └─ Auto-approved: 2 edits (22%)
└─ Rejected: 2 (18.2%)
```

#### Lines of Code
```
Accepted: +186 lines, -9 lines (net: +177)
Rejected: 0 lines (no changes applied)
```

#### Token Usage Analysis
```
ACCEPTED EDITS:
  • Count: 9 edits
  • Total tokens: 7,531
  • Avg tokens/edit: 837
  • Avg LOC/edit: 21

REJECTED EDITS:
  • Count: 2 edits
  • Total tokens: 3,769
  • Avg tokens/edit: 1,885
  • Avg LOC/edit: 0
```

**Insight:** Rejected edits used 2.25x more tokens on average than accepted edits, suggesting they may have been more complex or unclear changes.

#### Acceptance by Type
```
✓ ACCEPT - ONCE (manual):
  • Count: 6 edits
  • Total LOC: 90
  • Avg tokens: 740/edit
  • Avg LOC: 15/edit

✓ ACCEPT - ALWAYS:
  • Count: 1 edit
  • Total LOC: 2
  • Avg tokens: 152/edit
  • Avg LOC: 2/edit

✓ ACCEPT - AUTO:
  • Count: 2 edits
  • Total LOC: 94
  • Avg tokens: 1,470/edit
  • Avg LOC: 47/edit

✗ REJECT:
  • Count: 2 edits
  • Total LOC: 0
  • Avg tokens: 1,884/edit
```

**Insight:** Auto-approved edits had the highest LOC/edit (47 lines), suggesting user trusted the AI for larger changes after initial manual review.
